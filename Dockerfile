# Add sources to `code` and work there:
WORKDIR /code
ADD . /code

# Install flask-appfactory:
RUN pip install -e .

# Run container as user `flask-appfactory` with UID `1000`, which should match
# current host user in most situations:
RUN adduser --uid 1000 --disabled-password --gecos '' flaskappfactory && \
    chown -R flaskappfactory:flaskappfactory /code

# Run test suite instead of starting the application:
USER flaskappfactory
CMD ["python", "setup.py", "test"]
